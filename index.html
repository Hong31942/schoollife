	<h1> Studying at NFLSBCA <h1>
	<h3> BCA, as it is a famous school, I always have a busy life at school... although the classes are sometimes difficult, I never stop learning about all the courses although whole semesters are nearly finished.</h3>
  <a href="https://imgtu.com/i/gjbeN4"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/05/24/gjbeN4.jpg" alt="gjbeN4.jpg" border="0" /></a>
  <h3> I usually have good grades at school since I can achieve a balance between study and life. Keeping that in mind will always be helpful.</h3>

  <p> Study & Life </p>
	<h3> My grades have always been OK in these three years. Although there might be some fluctuations, I still insist and continue to become better. </h3>
  <a href="https://imgtu.com/i/gjbZEF"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/05/24/gjbZEF.jpg" alt="gjbZEF.jpg" border="0" /></a>
	<h3> I cannot predict what life will be like at my university, but I would like to say that, the purpose of studying is to make oneself become better and better, so I will not stop studying hard. </h3>
  <h2> A lazy youth, a lousy age.</h2>
    

  <h1> Activities </h1>
  <h2> NFLSBCA is always famous for its various activities, and I actually experienced and felt that in high school. </h2> 
  <h3> I used to be very quiet and shy, but I have changed in some ways when taking the activities in BCA. </h3>
  <a href="https://imgtu.com/i/gjvEHx"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/05/24/gjvEHx.jpg" alt="gjvEHx.jpg" border="0" /></a>
	<h3> In Grade 10, I tried to take as many clubs as some Grade 12 students suggested, but then I found my weak personality - I cannot overcome my SHYNESS and FEAR when communicating with others. </h3>
  <h3> But luckily, there are guys that treated me very well in clubs and I really wanted to thank them for taking care of me. They are the ones that first contributed to the changes that always continued in these years. </h3>
  	<a href="https://imgtu.com/i/gjv8bt"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/05/24/gjv8bt.jpg" alt="gjv8bt.jpg" border="0" /></a>
  <h3> I will also thank the BCA teachers for helping me. They are not only teachers but wise and knowledgeable friends. </h3>

  <h2> Then, in Grade 11 and Grade 12, I did a lot of things I never thought of... </h2>
  <h3> Like running for the Students' Council... Like being the leader of one club...</h3>
  	<a href="https://imgtu.com/i/gjv5rR"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/05/24/gjv5rR.jpg" alt="gjv5rR.jpg" border="0" /></a>
  	<p> Communicating with the trainer </p>
  <h3> From these experiences, I got valuable experiences that will be beneficial to me. I also understand what to do in the future.</h3>
  <h3> NFLSBCA helps me understand a lot of things that I have never thought of before. I am grateful for the assistance from BCA, and I hope I can remember all the good school memories in BCA in the future.</h3> 

  <h1> University Life - King's College London </h1>
  <h3> King's College London is a world-famous university with a long history. There are beautiful buildings everywhere on its campuses, so walking through King's always makes me feel the flying time. </h3>

  <h3> University life is significantly different from high school life. Students are more independent with their own plans. Everybody is working hard towards their purposes. </h3>

  <h3> In King's, I also met many schoolmates from different majors and countries. We discussed about our study and life. </h3>
  <h3> After class, we also cooked together, travelled together and had parties together, it was all beautiful memories. </h3>
